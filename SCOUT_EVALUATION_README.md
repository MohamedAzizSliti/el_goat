# üîç Scout Evaluation System

## Overview
The El Goat app now features a comprehensive scout evaluation system that allows scouts to evaluate football players with detailed ratings across technical, physical, and mental attributes. The system provides structured evaluation forms, rating scales, and recommendation tracking.

## üéØ Features

### ‚ú® Comprehensive Player Evaluation
- **Technical Skills Assessment**: Ball control, passing accuracy, shooting ability, dribbling, crossing, and heading
- **Physical Attributes Rating**: Speed, stamina, strength, agility, and jumping ability
- **Mental Attributes Evaluation**: Decision making, positioning, communication, leadership, work rate, and attitude
- **Overall Assessment**: Overall rating and potential rating (1-10 scale)
- **Recommendation System**: Highly Recommend, Recommend, Consider, Not Recommend

### üìä Rating System
- **1-10 Scale**: All attributes rated on a consistent 1-10 scale
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded sliders and ratings (red for poor, green for excellent)
- **Interactive Sliders**: Easy-to-use rating sliders with real-time visual feedback
- **Star Ratings**: 5-star display system for quick visual assessment

### üìù Detailed Documentation
- **Match Context**: Optional field to specify evaluation context (match, training, etc.)
- **Strengths & Weaknesses**: Text fields for detailed observations
- **Additional Notes**: Free-form text for any additional comments
- **Date Tracking**: Evaluation date with validation

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### Scout Evaluations Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE scout_evaluations (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    scout_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    player_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    
    -- Basic Info

    match_context TEXT,
    player_position TEXT NOT NULL,
    
    -- Technical Skills (1-10)
    ball_control INTEGER CHECK (ball_control >= 1 AND ball_control <= 10),
    passing_accuracy INTEGER CHECK (passing_accuracy >= 1 AND passing_accuracy <= 10),
    shooting_ability INTEGER CHECK (shooting_ability >= 1 AND shooting_ability <= 10),
    dribbling_skills INTEGER CHECK (dribbling_skills >= 1 AND dribbling_skills <= 10),
    crossing_ability INTEGER CHECK (crossing_ability >= 1 AND crossing_ability <= 10),
    heading_ability INTEGER CHECK (heading_ability >= 1 AND heading_ability <= 10),

```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Models
- **ScoutEvaluation**: Complete evaluation data structure with all ratings and metadata
- **RecommendationType**: Enum for recommendation levels (Highly Recommend, Recommend, Consider, Not Recommend)

### Services
- **ScoutEvaluationService**: Database operations for evaluations (CRUD, search, statistics)
- **Validation**: Ensures data integrity and prevents duplicate evaluations on same date

### UI Components
- **ScoutEvaluationFormPage**: Main evaluation form with all rating sections
- **RatingSlider**: Interactive slider component with color-coded feedback
- **RatingDisplay**: Read-only rating display with progress bars
- **RatingStars**: Star-based rating display for quick visual assessment

## üì± Usage Examples

### Creating an Evaluation
```dart
// Navigate to evaluation form
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(
    builder: (context) => ScoutEvaluationFormPage(
      player: footballerProfile,
    ),
  ),
);
```

### Loading Scout's Evaluations
```dart
final evaluations = await ScoutEvaluationService().getEvaluationsByScout(scoutId);
```

### Getting Player Statistics
```dart
final stats = await ScoutEvaluationService().getPlayerEvaluationStats(playerId);
```

### Searching Evaluations
```dart
final evaluations = await ScoutEvaluationService().searchEvaluations(
  playerPosition: 'Striker',
  recommendation: RecommendationType.highlyRecommend,
  minOverallRating: 8,
);
```

## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
Run the SQL script in `database/scout_evaluations_table.sql` in your Supabase dashboard:
```bash
# Execute the SQL file in Supabase SQL Editor
```

### 2. Dependencies
The following packages are required:
- `supabase_flutter: ^2.9.0` - Database operations
- `flutter/material.dart` - UI components

### 3. Integration
Add the evaluation form to your scout interface:
```dart
// In scout profile or player list
FloatingActionButton(
  onPressed: () => Navigator.push(
    context,
    MaterialPageRoute(
      builder: (context) => ScoutEvaluationFormPage(player: selectedPlayer),
    ),
  ),
  child: Icon(Icons.assessment),
)
```

## üîí Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- Scouts can only view and manage their own evaluations
- Players can view evaluations about themselves
- Proper authentication checks for all operations

### Data Validation
- All ratings constrained to 1-10 scale
- Unique constraint prevents duplicate evaluations on same date
- Required field validation in UI

### Privacy Protection
- Evaluation data is properly scoped to authorized users
- No unauthorized access to evaluation details

## üìä Analytics & Statistics

### Evaluation Statistics View
```sql
CREATE VIEW scout_evaluation_stats AS
SELECT 
    player_id,
    COUNT(*) as total_evaluations,
    ROUND(AVG(overall_rating), 2) as avg_overall_rating,
    ROUND(AVG(potential_rating), 2) as avg_potential_rating,
    -- ... more statistics
FROM scout_evaluations
GROUP BY player_id;
```

### Available Metrics
