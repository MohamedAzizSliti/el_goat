# 🔍 Debug Guide: Gemini "Same Data" Issue

## 🚨 Current Issue
You mentioned that `print('Response body: ${response.body}');` doesn't show anything, which means the API call is failing.

## 📋 Step-by-Step Debugging

### 1. **Check Your Console Output**
When you generate exercises, you should see these debug messages:

```
🎯 Starting exercise generation for [Player Name]
🎯 Focus areas: [Selected Areas]
🎯 Count: 3
```

**If you DON'T see these messages:**
- The generation function isn't being called
- Check if the AI button is working

### 2. **Check API Key Configuration**
Look for this message:
```
❌ API key not configured, using fallback exercises
```

**If you see this:**
- Your API key is not set up correctly
- Follow the setup guide in `GEMINI_SETUP_GUIDE.md`

### 3. **Check API Call Debugging**
If API key is configured, you should see:
```
✅ API key is configured, proceeding with AI generation
📝 Generated prompt, calling Gemini API...
🚀 Starting Gemini API call...
🔑 API Key configured: true
🔑 API Key (first 10 chars): AIzaSyC...
📝 Prompt length: [number] characters
📦 Request body length: [number] characters
🌐 Making API call to: https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/...
```

### 4. **Check Response Status**
Look for:
```
📊 Response Status Code: [number]
📄 Response Body: [content]
```

**Common Status Codes:**
- **200**: Success ✅
- **400**: Bad Request (invalid API key or request)
- **403**: Forbidden (API key issues)
- **429**: Rate limit exceeded
- **500**: Server error

## 🔧 Quick Fixes

### Fix 1: API Key Not Configured
1. Open `lib/config/api_config.dart`
2. Replace `'PUT_YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE'` with your real API key
3. Restart the app completely

### Fix 2: Invalid API Key
1. Get a new API key from: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
2. Make sure it starts with `AIza`
3. Update the config file

### Fix 3: Network Issues
1. Check internet connection
2. Try on a different network
3. Check if your firewall blocks the API

## 🧪 Test the Fix

### Step 1: Run the App
1. Start your app
2. Go to AI Training screen
3. Click the AI generation button (✨)
4. Select focus areas
5. Click "Generate"

### Step 2: Check Console Output

### Step 3: Expected Flow
```
🎯 Starting exercise generation for [Player]
✅ API key is configured, proceeding with AI generation
📝 Generated prompt, calling Gemini API...
🚀 Starting Gemini API call...
